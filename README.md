## Executive Summary
I will be looking at the price of gas from 1935 to present in the United States and its 
relationship to U.S. Presidents and Political Parties.

## Motivation
My motivation was a simple debate about if U.S. Presidents influence the price of gas 
in the United States. With the price of gas currently increasing, I believe that it would 
be an interesting topic.

## Data Question
What President, Presidentâ€™s Approval Rate, and Political Party is associated with the 
highest/lowest price of gas?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Mainly, I will be using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualizations. My 
audience would be any individual interested in the topic.
